# COVID Ultrasound data collection initiative

# Here, we gather ultrasound data from human lungs, especially from COVID 19 patients. Detecting COVID-19 from POCUS is challenging and time-consuming, even for trained medical doctors. Since the time of doctors is scarce, there is an urgent need to simplify, fasten & automatize the detection of COVID-19, especially non-invasively.  

## Please contribute your own images here or tell us directly where to find them.

   <em>Example lung ultrasound images. (A): A typical COVID-19 infected lung, showing small subpleural consolidation and pleural irregularities. (B): A pneumonia infected lung, with dynamic air bronchograms surrounded by alveolar consolidation. (C) Healthy lung. 
The lung is normally aerated with horizontal A-lines.</em>
