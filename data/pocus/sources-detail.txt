Consolidation = More specific of regular pneumonia, but Covid ends look like this or trigger a bacteriial infection which turns into a consolidation. ("known as hepatization because the lung is becoming so thick that  it looks like a liver on the  screen)
Skip Lesion = More specific of viral pneumonia--> but we could consider that viral pneumonia=Covid during these times

Cov-grepmed3.mp4 : moderate pleural effusion, few B-lines, no consolidation
Cov-grepmed2.mp4 : minimal effusion, lots of (beautiful) B-lines, no consolidation, fast breathing (if the video is real-time) [I forgot to tell you that since POCUS is dynamic, you can count the number of breaths per minute!]
Cov-grepmed.mp4 : Image too shallow to be really helpfull even if we can see some B-lines. Do not use in my opinion
Cov-grepmed-blines-pocus-.mp4 : minimal effusion, lots of (really beautiful) B-lines, no consolidation, fast breathing
Cov-MSU-SkipLesions.mp4 : no effusion, B-lines, really narrow field of view, beware of the added green dot that moves over the image
Cov-MSU-COVID Lung 2-Blines.mp4 : Minimal effusion, pleural irregularities, lots of B-lines
Cov-MSU-COVID Consolidation.mp4: Small cluster of consolidation, no visible B-lines. Likely late stage of COVID (and doesnot happpen in every patient, some belive this is caused by another germ taking the oppurtunity but still has to be confirmed)
Cov-Butterfly-COVID Skip Lesion.mp4 : no effusion, pleural irregularities, B-lines and areas without either B-lines nor A-lines : those areas are not properly consolidatd yet but are no normal lung anymore.
Cov-Butterfly-COVID Lung 2.mp4 : Minimal effusion, pleural irregularities, lots of B-lines
Cov-Butterfly-COVID Lung 1.mp4 : No effusion (or maybe minimal) pleural irregularties, B-lines
Cov-Butterfly-COVID Consolidation.mp4 : Same clip as Cov-MSU-COVID Consolidation.mp4. Do not use both!Nou used anyway.
Cov-Atlas-Day%2B5.gif : Small resolution. Left clip : Pleural irregularities, minimal effusion, we can see the image switching from B-lines (sick lung) to normal lung : some part of the lungs are infected, others not yet. Nice clip :) // Right clip : Discrete pleura thickening, lots of B-lines
Cov-Atlas-Day%2B4.gif : Minimal to moderate effusion, pleural thickening, probably some underlying consolidation, not the best clip but might be feeded to the NN
Cov-Atlas-Day+3.gif : moderate effusion, not fully sure but probable consolidation
Cov-Atlas-Day+2.gif : moderate effusion, B-lines, still cannot be sure about consolidation
Cov-Atlas-Day+1.gif : No effusion, clear consolidation in one part of the lung. We can see the limits of the pneumonia (consolidated) surrounded by healthy lung!
Cov-Atlas-+(43).gif : Pleural irregularities, lots of B-lines
Cov-Atlas+(45).gif : Pleural irregularties, can't really tell for the rest
Cov-Atlas+(44).gif: consolidated



Pneu-Atlas-pneumonia-AirBronch.gif = consolidated
Pneu-Atlas-pneumonia.gif = Tricky one... There is a pleural effusion (the black space betwin the chest wall and the lungs), a delimited area of consolidation in the middle and B-lines on the rigth side of the image. I'd rate this one in a "non-viral pneumonia"
Pneu-Atlas-pneumonia2.gif = consolidated
Pneu-grep-pneumonia1.mp4 = Consolidated... Oh God, is this even a lung anymore?
Pneu-grep-pneumonia2.mp4 = consolidated
Pneu-grep-pneumonia3.mp4 = Low-fi consolidation
Pneu-grep-pneumonia4.mp4 = Low-fi consolidation
Pneu-grep-pneumonia5.mp4 = Quality to bad to be sur, but probably consolidated even if we see some scattered B-lines. I'd rather not use this one to teach a NN (edited) 

Reg-C_ConvexProb_score0 = tested positive for the RNA test but no lung injury related to covid
Reg-D_ConvexProb_score0 = tested positive for the RNA test but no lung injury related to covid
